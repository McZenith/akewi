### Screens

| Screen            | Status | Notes                     |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| Onboarding/Login  | ⏳     | Analyzed, not implemented |
| User Details Form | ⏳     | Analyzed, not implemented |

## Current Tasks

- Analyzed first screen (Onboarding/Login)
- Analyzed second screen (User Details Form)
- Identified initial components
- Established theme tokens based on first screen
- Observed keyboard behavior on login screen
- Identified accessibility voice feature for screen reading
- Added support for both email and phone authentication
- Analyzed language selection modal component
- Observed full Yoruba translation of the login screen
- Observed full Yoruba translation of the User Details form

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Analyze design system (colors, typography, spacing)
2. ✅ Identify core components and their variations
3. ✅ Document multilingual support with specific examples
4. ✅ Analyze multilingual form fields and inputs
5. Continue analyzing screens as designs are provided
6. Implement theme constants file (constants/theme.ts)
7. Set up i18n infrastructure with English and Yoruba language files
8. Begin implementing base UI components
9. Set up navigation structure with Expo Router
10. Implement dual authentication flow (email and phone)
11. Implement user profile creation flow

## Challenges & Decisions

- **Theme Values**: We've inferred theme values from the first screen. These may need adjustment as we analyze more screens.
- **Authentication Flow**: We need to implement a flexible authentication system that supports both email and phone verification paths.
- **Language Support**: The UI shows fully localized screens in both English UK and Yoruba. We've documented specific translation examples to aid in implementation. Note that some content appears to be adapted for cultural relevance rather than directly translated.
- **Keyboard Handling**: The design shows the keyboard appearing below the input field without covering it. We'll need to implement proper keyboard avoiding view behavior.
- **Accessibility Features**: The voice button is actually a screen reader accessibility feature that reads form fields aloud in the user's selected language and highlights the element being read. We'll need to implement Text-to-Speech functionality with multi-language support.
- **State/Location Data**: We'll need a database of states and towns, potentially localized for different languages. The town and state names will need to be presented in the user's selected language.
- **Form Validation**: We'll need to implement field validation with support for localized error messages.
- **Input Type Detection**: We need to implement logic to automatically detect whether the user entered an email or phone number and adjust the validation and authentication flow accordingly.
- **UI Flexibility**: The UI layout needs to accommodate text length variations between languages. For example, Yoruba text in form fields is typically longer than the English equivalent.
